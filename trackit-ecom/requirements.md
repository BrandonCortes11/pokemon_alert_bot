## Database Schema Design
SCHEMADESIGN

This section outlines the database schema for the "TrackIt Ecom" application, detailing the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. The design prioritizes data integrity, scalability, flexibility for customization, and efficient reporting, leveraging PostgreSQL features through Supabase.

**1. Core Design Principles**
*   **Normalization**: The schema is designed with a focus on normalization to minimize data redundancy and ensure data consistency.
*   **Scalability**: Utilizing UUIDs for primary keys, appropriate indexing, and considering Row-Level Security (RLS) with PostgreSQL will support anticipated user growth and data volume.
*   **Flexibility & Customization**: Customizable categories, support for various API integrations, and JSONB fields for preferences ensure the application can adapt to diverse business needs and future features.
*   **Data Integrity & Accuracy**: An "Approval Queue" system is central to ensuring that automatically fetched data is reviewed and validated by the user before being committed, maintaining high data accuracy.
*   **Auditability**: Timestamps for creation and updates are included in most tables to track data lifecycle.

**2. Entity-Relationship Overview**
The core entities revolve around `Users`, their `Businesses`, `Expenses`, `Revenues`, `Products`, `Categories`, and `API Integrations`.
*   A `User` can manage multiple `Businesses`.
*   Each `Business` has its own `Expenses`, `Revenues`, `Products`, and custom `Categories`.
*   `Expenses` and `Revenues` are linked to specific `Categories` and can be associated with `Products`.
*   `API Integrations` are set up by `Users` to fetch data, which then goes into an `API Approval Queue` before being recorded as `Expenses` or `Revenues`.

*   **Aggregations**: Daily, weekly, or monthly summaries, along with KPIs (Profit & Loss, Profit Margin Percentage, Cash Flow, Expense Breakdown, Sales Trends, Product Profitability, Customer Acquisition Costs), will be generated via SQL queries using `GROUP BY` clauses on the `transaction_date` and joining with `categories` and `products` tables. For performance at scale, materialized views can be introduced for frequently accessed aggregated data.
*   **Product-Specific Analysis**: The `expense_product_associations` and `revenue_product_associations` tables enable linking transactions to individual products, allowing for profitability analysis at the product level.

**6. API Integration Data Flow**

1.  **Configuration**: Users configure API integrations in `api_account_integrations`, storing encrypted credentials.
2.  **Automated Fetching**: A background service regularly queries external APIs (Facebook Graph API, Instagram Business API, WhatsApp Business API) for relevant expense and revenue data points.
3.  **Ingestion Logging**: Each sync process is logged in `api_data_ingestion_logs`.
4.  **Queueing for Approval**: Raw fetched data is parsed, enriched (e.g., auto-suggested category), and placed into the `api_approval_queue` table. Duplicate detection and conflict identification mechanisms populate the `detected_issues` array.
5.  **User Review**: The user interface presents items from `api_approval_queue` for review. Users can:
    *   `Approve`: Move the data into `expenses` or `revenues` tables "as is."
    *   `Edit`: Modify `proposed_amount`, `description`, `transaction_date`, `category_id`, add `notes` or `tags` before approving and moving to `expenses`/`revenues`.
    *   `Categorize`: Assign or reassign categories.
    *   `Reject`/`Delete`: Remove the item from the queue without recording it.
    *   `Flag for Review`: Mark an item for later scrutiny.
    *   `Merge`: Handle duplicates by merging information into one approved record.
6.  **Persistence**: Upon approval (or editing and approval), the data is moved from `api_approval_queue` to the `expenses` or `revenues` table, with a foreign key reference back to the `approval_id`.

**7. Security Considerations in Schema**

*   **Authentication & Authorization**: Supabase Auth handles user login. Row-Level Security (RLS) policies will be rigorously applied to all tables (`businesses`, `expenses`, `revenues`, `products`, `categories`, `api_account_integrations`, `api_approval_queue`) to ensure users can only access and modify data belonging to their `user_id` or associated `business_id`.
*   **Sensitive Data Storage**: API `access_token_encrypted` and `refresh_token_encrypted` fields are designed to store sensitive tokens in an encrypted format within the database. This encryption can be managed via Supabase's built-in vault features or through application-level encryption before data persistence.
*   **Data Minimization**: The schema is designed to collect only the essential data points required for the application's functionality.
*   **Auditability**: `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps on most tables, along with Supabase's audit logs, support tracking changes.

**8. Extensibility**

The schema is built with extensibility in mind for future integrations:
*   The `api_account_integrations.platform` enum can be expanded to include new e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce), payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal), accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero), and other advertising/logistics platforms.
*   The `source` enum in `expenses` and `revenues` can also be extended.
*   The `raw_data` JSONB field in `api_approval_queue` provides flexibility to store varied data structures from new APIs without immediate schema alterations, allowing for gradual integration of specific fields as needed.
*   Modular design, where new integration types might introduce their own specific data tables (e.g., `shopify_orders`), can easily be linked to core `expenses` and `revenues` tables via reference IDs, maintaining the financial core without bloating it.

## User Flow
USERFLOW

1. User Flow: Onboarding & Initial Setup
   User Goal: Set up their TrackIt Ecom account, connect social media platforms, and prepare for automated data tracking.
   Trigger: First-time app launch after successful registration/login.

   Steps/Interactions:
   1. Welcome Screen:
      - Wireframe Description: A simple screen displaying the app's logo, a brief welcome message (e.g., "Simplify your e-commerce finances!"), and a prominent "Get Started" button.
      - Interaction Pattern: User taps the "Get Started" button.
      - System Action: Proceeds to the next setup step.
   2. Platform Connection Prompt:
      - Wireframe Description: A screen titled "Connect Your Business Accounts" with sections or cards for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp Business. Each section includes the platform's logo, a brief description of what data will be synced (e.g., "Ad spend & campaign performance"), and a "Connect" button. Explanatory text emphasizes data privacy and security.
      - Interaction Pattern: User taps the "Connect" button for Facebook (then repeats for Instagram and WhatsApp).
      - System Action: Initiates the OAuth 2.0 flow for the respective platform, redirecting the user to the platform's secure login/permission page.
   3. External OAuth Authorization (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp):
      - Wireframe Description: (External to the app) The user is directed to the social media platform's official login and permissions page. They will log in (if not already) and review the permissions requested by TrackIt Ecom (e.g., "Read your ad accounts", "Access business insights").
      - Interaction Pattern: User grants the requested permissions.
      - System Action: The platform redirects the user back to TrackIt Ecom with an authorization token. TrackIt Ecom's backend uses this token to establish the API connection.
   4. Connection Confirmation & Initial Data Sync:
      - Wireframe Description: Upon successful connection, the platform's status on the "Connect Your Business Accounts" screen changes from "Connect" to "Connected". A loading indicator or progress bar appears (e.g., "Syncing initial data from connected accounts..."). Messages like "Fetching Facebook Ads data...", "Retrieving Instagram insights...", "Analyzing WhatsApp conversations..." may cycle.
      - Interaction Pattern: User waits for the initial sync to complete. They can see progress or read tips.
      - System Action: The app's backend initiates API calls to fetch historical data from all connected platforms (e.g., last 3-6 months of ad spend, sales conversions, relevant chat data).
   5. Dashboard Preview & Guided Tour:
      - Wireframe Description: After the initial sync, the user is directed to their main dashboard. Initially, it might display aggregated data or placeholder insights. A brief, interactive guided tour or tooltips might appear, highlighting key sections (e.g., "This is your Total Profit KPI", "Click here to see your expense breakdown").
      - Interaction Pattern: User explores the dashboard, dismisses the tour, or clicks on highlighted areas.
      - System Action: The dashboard updates in real-time as data continues to populate. User preferences (like default currency, date range) are applied.

      - Interaction Pattern: User taps "Reconnect" to re-authenticate an expired connection, or "Disconnect" to remove an integration (with confirmation).
      - System Action: Manages OAuth token refresh and revocation. If disconnected, stops future automated data fetches from that platform.

   Error Handling/Edge Cases:
   - Category Deletion with Transactions: The system presents a warning and offers to reassign affected transactions to another category before permanent deletion, preventing data loss.
   - Reconnection Failure: If "Reconnect" fails, the app provides specific guidance (e.g., "Please check your credentials on Facebook's website and try again.") rather than a generic error.
   - Invalid Input for Settings: For free-text settings (if any), input validation ensures valid data is saved.

*   **D. Feedback & Responsiveness:**
    *   **Timely Feedback:** Provide immediate visual or textual feedback for user actions, such as loading indicators for API calls, success messages for saved data, and clear error messages for input validation or system issues.
    *   **System Alerts:** Use accent colors and clear messaging for important alerts (e.g., "duplicate entry detected", "missing information").
    *   **Adaptive Layouts:** Design layouts that gracefully adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile), ensuring optimal usability regardless of device.

*   **E. Automated Data & Approval Workflows:**
    *   **Minimal Intervention UI:** Design the automated data review interface to be highly efficient, allowing users to approve, edit, categorize, add notes, reject, or flag data entries with minimal clicks.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** Clearly highlight discrepancies (e.g., conflicting amounts) and provide intuitive options for users to resolve them (e.g., "Merge", "Edit", "Discard").
    *   **Duplicate Detection:** Visually alert users to potential duplicate entries and offer one-click options to merge or delete.
    *   **Guidance for Missing Data:** Prompt users concisely when essential information (e.g., category, date) is missing from an automated entry, offering defaults or direct input fields.
    *   **Visual Cues:** Differentiate between automatically fetched data and manually entered data (e.g., with small icons or subtle background variations) to provide context.

*   **F. Accessibility:**
    *   **High Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements to meet WCAG guidelines.
    *   **Keyboard Navigation:** Support full keyboard navigation for all interactive components.
